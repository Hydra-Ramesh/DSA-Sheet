Hereâ€™s the short logic to find the length of the last word:

1. **Skip Trailing Spaces**: Start from the end and move left until you find a non-space character.
2. **Count Last Word's Length**: From the last character, count each character in the word until you reach a space or the beginning of the string.

This will give you the length of the last word directly.
