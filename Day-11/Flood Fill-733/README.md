Here's a concise breakdown of the logic behind the flood fill algorithm:

1. **Goal**:
   - Starting from a given cell `(sr, sc)`, replace the color of that cell and all connected cells (in four directions) that have the same color with a new color.

2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:
   - Use a recursive DFS to explore each cell.
   - If the current cell matches the initial color, change it to the new color.
   - Continue DFS to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) until all connected cells with the initial color are updated.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - Stop recursion if the cell is:
     - Out of bounds.
     - A different color than the initial color.
     - Already filled with the new color (to avoid infinite loops).

4. **Flood Fill Function**:
   - Check if the cellâ€™s color is already the target color to avoid redundant processing.
   - If not, initiate DFS from the starting cell to begin the flood fill.

This approach ensures that all connected cells with the initial color get updated efficiently.
