Here’s the concept for checking if a string is a valid palindrome:

1. **Filter the String**: Create a new string containing only alphanumeric characters from the input, converting them all to lowercase.
2. **Reverse and Compare**: Reverse the filtered string and compare it with the original filtered version.
3. **Palindrome Check**: If the filtered string reads the same forward and backward, it’s a palindrome; otherwise, it’s not.

This approach handles spaces, punctuation, and case differences by only considering alphanumeric characters in lowercase.
