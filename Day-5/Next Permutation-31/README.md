### Logic for `nextPermutation` Function:

The `nextPermutation` function rearranges the given vector of numbers into the next lexicographically larger permutation. If no such permutation exists (i.e., the current arrangement is the largest possible), it rearranges the numbers into the smallest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Steps and Logic:

1. **Find the First Decreasing Element**:
   - Start from the end of the array and move left. Find the first index `idx` where `nums[idx] < nums[idx + 1]`. This identifies the pivot where a larger permutation is possible.
   - If no such index is found (`idx == -1`), it means the array is sorted in descending order, and it's the largest permutation. In this case, reverse the array to get the smallest permutation and return.

2. **Reverse the Right Subarray**:
   - Once we find `idx`, reverse the subarray from `idx + 1` to the end. This ensures the smallest possible arrangement of elements after the pivot.

3. **Find the Smallest Element Larger Than `nums[idx]`**:
   - After reversing the right subarray, find the smallest element greater than `nums[idx]` to the right of `idx`. This will be the next element in the permutation sequence.

4. **Swap and Complete the Next Permutation**:
   - Swap `nums[idx]` with the element found in step 3.
   - The array is now in the next lexicographical permutation.
