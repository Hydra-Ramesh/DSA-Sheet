The logic behind the `gcdOfStrings` function is:

1. **Check Compatibility**: If concatenating `str1 + str2` does not equal `str2 + str1`, the strings cannot be made by repeating the same base string. In that case, return an empty string `""`.

2. **Find GCD of Lengths**: Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. This tells us the length of the largest possible repeating unit that can generate both strings.

3. **Return the Substring**: Return the substring of `str1` from the start up to the GCD length, as this is the common divisor string.
