**Linked List**
### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - `slow` pointer: Moves one node at a time.
   - `fast` pointer: Moves two nodes at a time.

2. **Traverse the List**:
   - Both pointers start at the head of the list.
   - For every step:
     - Move the `slow` pointer one step forward.
     - Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward.

3. **Stop Condition**:
   - The loop continues until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list or becomes `NULL` (for odd or even-length lists).
   - When the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node of the list.

4. **Return the Middle Node**:
   - Once the loop finishes, return the `slow` pointer, which will now be pointing at the middle node.

### Why This Works:

- The `fast` pointer covers twice as many nodes as the `slow` pointer, so by the time the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be halfway (i.e., at the middle).
  
### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: You only traverse the list once, making it linear in terms of time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space used is constant, as only two pointers are utilized, regardless of the list size.

This technique is efficient because it requires only a single pass through the list and uses minimal additional space.
