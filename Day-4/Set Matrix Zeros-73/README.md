**2d Matrix**
### Problem Summary:
Given a 2D matrix, if any element is `0`, you need to set the entire row and column of that element to `0`.

### Logic Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**:
   - First, retrieve the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) in the matrix.

2. **Track if First Row and First Column Need to Be Zeroed**:
   - You cannot modify the matrix while traversing it, so use the first row and the first column as markers.
   - Additionally, keep two boolean flags, `firstRowZero` and `firstColZero`, to remember if the first row or column contains any zeroes.
     - **Why?** Youâ€™ll use these flags at the end because the first row and column are used as markers and need to be handled separately.

3. **Check the First Column**:
   - Traverse through the first column to check if any element is `0`.
   - If any element in the first column is `0`, set `firstColZero` to `true`.

4. **Check the First Row**:
   - Traverse through the first row to check if any element is `0`.
   - If any element in the first row is `0`, set `firstRowZero` to `true`.

5. **Mark Rows and Columns for Zeroing**:
   - Start iterating over the matrix from the second row (`i=1`) and the second column (`j=1`).
   - For each element `matrix[i][j]`, if it is `0`, mark the corresponding row and column by setting:
     - `matrix[i][0] = 0` (mark the first element of that row).
     - `matrix[0][j] = 0` (mark the first element of that column).

6. **Zero the Marked Rows**:
   - Now, iterate through the matrix again (from the second row onwards).
   - For any row `i` where `matrix[i][0]` is `0`, set all elements in that row to `0`.

7. **Zero the Marked Columns**:
   - Similarly, for any column `j` where `matrix[0][j]` is `0`, set all elements in that column to `0`.

8. **Handle the First Row and Column**:
   - After using the first row and column as markers, check the flags `firstRowZero` and `firstColZero`.
   - If `firstRowZero` is `true`, set the entire first row to zero.
   - If `firstColZero` is `true`, set the entire first column to zero.

### Key Points:
- **First Row and Column as Markers**: Instead of creating separate arrays to track which rows and columns to set to zero, the first row and column are used to store these flags efficiently.
- **Two Passes**: The algorithm makes two passes:
  1. First pass to mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed.
  2. Second pass to actually set the corresponding rows and columns to zero.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Special care is taken to handle the first row and column separately because they are also used as markers.
