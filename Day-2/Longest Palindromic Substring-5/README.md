***String***
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a string using `cin >> s`.

2. **Calling the `longestPalindrome` Function**:
   - The `Solution` object `sol` is created.
   - The `longestPalindrome` function is called using `sol.longestPalindrome(s)` with the input string `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The result, which is the longest palindromic substring, is printed to the console using `cout`.

This function allows you to interact with the program by entering a string and receiving the longest palindromic substring as output.
