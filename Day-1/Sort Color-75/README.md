***Dautch Flag Algorithm***
Step 1: Take three pointer as like Binary search.
Step 2: Initialize first 2 at the beginning of the array and last 1 at the end of the array.
Step 3: Take a while loop and start a ladder condition and check for 2nd pointer that is is 0 or 2.
Step 4: If it zero then swap the 1st two pointers.
and move the pointer ahead.
Step 5: If it is two then swap the last two pointers.
and reduce the last pointer.
Step 6: For different case means for 1 just increase the 2nd pointer.
