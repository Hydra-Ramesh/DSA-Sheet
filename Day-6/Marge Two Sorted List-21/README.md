**Linked List**

### Short Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - You initialize pointers `tempA` and `tempB` to traverse the two input lists `a` and `b`.
   - You create a dummy node `c` (with an arbitrary value of `100`), and `tempC` is used to build the merged list starting from this dummy node.

2. **Merging**:
   - While both `tempA` and `tempB` are non-NULL, you compare the values of the nodes they point to:
     - If `tempA->val <= tempB->val`, you create a new node with `tempA->val` and append it to the merged list, moving `tempA` forward.
     - If `tempB->val < tempA->val`, you create a new node with `tempB->val` and append it to the merged list, moving `tempB` forward.
   
3. **Appending Remaining Nodes**:
   - After the loop, one of the lists might still have remaining nodes. You simply append the rest of that list to the merged list.

4. **Return**:
   - You return the merged list starting from `c->next`, skipping the dummy node.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of the two input lists.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as you only use a few extra pointers, and no new list nodes are created unnecessarily.

This version is more optimal in terms of memory usage and simpler to implement.
