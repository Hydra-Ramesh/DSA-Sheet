Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of the logic for finding the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is less than a given value `k`:

### Logic Breakdown

1. **Initial Condition**:
   - If `k <= 1`, return `0`, since no subarray can have a product less than `k`.

2. **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, `i` (left) and `j` (right), to create a sliding window over the array.
   - Maintain a `product` variable to track the product of elements within the window.

3. **Expand the Window**:
   - Increment the right pointer `j` to expand the window and multiply `nums[j]` to the `product`.

4. **Shrink the Window**:
   - If the `product` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, increment the left pointer `i` to reduce the window size:
     - Divide `product` by `nums[i]` to exclude the leftmost element from the product until `product < k`.

5. **Count Valid Subarrays**:
   - For each valid position of `j`, the number of subarrays ending at `j` is `(j - i + 1)`, since all subarrays from index `i` to `j` are valid.

6. **Return Count**:
   - Sum up the counts for all valid positions of `j` to get the total number of valid subarrays.
