Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of the logic:

1. **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**: Use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent a sliding window over the array.
   
2. **Count Flips**: Traverse the array with `j`. When `nums[j]` is `0`, increase a `flips` counter to track the number of zeroes "flipped" in the current window.

3. **Shrink Window If Over `k` Flips**: If `flips` exceeds `k`, increment `i` (shrink the window from the left) until `flips` is at most `k` again.

4. **Update Maximum Length**: For each valid window (where `flips <= k`), calculate the length and update `maxLen` if this length is the largest seen.

5. **Return `maxLen`**: After processing, `maxLen` holds the length of the longest subarray with at most `k` flipped zeroes.
